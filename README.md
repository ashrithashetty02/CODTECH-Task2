TASK-2:

Overview of the project:
STUDENT GRADE TRACKER
The Student Grade Tracker is a Python program designed to manage and analyze student grades by allowing users to input grades for multiple subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display a comprehensive performance summary. It determines the overall letter grade based on predefined thresholds and calculates the Grade Point Average (GPA) on a standard scale. The program ensures valid input, handles errors gracefully, and presents results clearly. It is a practical project for learning Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, data storage, and user-defined functions, with potential for enhancements like weighted grades, data visualization, or file storage integration.
